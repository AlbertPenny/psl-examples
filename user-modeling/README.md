### User Modeling

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to infer users’ personality trait from their social media profile. We try to predict whether a user is an extrovert user or an introvert user given her/his text, image, groups, likes and friendship links.

This is a synthetic dataset that is meant to showcase two things: collective classification and data fusion.

## Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and contains information about users’ social network, local personality predictions of each user from their generated text and image. We also include groups and likes, in which we assume that introvert users most likely like video-games and join groups related to anime movies and extrovert users are most likely like partying and join groups related to action movies. The social graph (i.e., friendship links) is generated as a scale-free network in which degree distribution follows a power law.
